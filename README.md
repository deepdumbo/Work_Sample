This is a brief collection of work that I have been working on since entering MSK May 2019. 

Papers/Abstracts:
The following abstracts were accepted for persentations for conferences of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. 
- "Personalized DCE-MRI parametric mapping of gynecological cancer using high spatiotemporal resolution GRASP" Kim N, ... , Otazo R. ISMRM 2020 Annual Conference and Exhibition. 
- "Motion-resistant XDGRASP for free-breathing liver MRI: qualitative comparison with standard breath-hold hepatobiliary phase imaging" Kim N, ... , Otazo R. ISMRM 2020 Annual Conference and Exhibition
- "MR SIGnature MAtching (MRSIGMA) with motion baseline drift adaptation for real-time volumetric motion tracking" Kim N,..., Otazo R. ISMRM 2020 Image Reconstruction and Data Sampling workshop.


Code Snippets: 
- KTSS
 A project focused on learning the basics of MR Imaging. Without looking at already published code, I recreated the k-t sparse sense reconstruction algorithm using Python. 
- MRSIGMA
 A proof-of-concept implementation of MRSIGMA and it's validation. While the main code cannot be published, this folder includes code snippets and a presentation that gives a bit of insight into the project.
- Deep Learning Reconstruction
Some code that has been developed in pursuing a deep learning reconstruction algorithm for MR Imaging.
